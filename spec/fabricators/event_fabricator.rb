	description			"As Berlin's burgeoning electronic music scene becomes ever-more a point of international focus, with numerous books and articles being written on its clubs, music, and parties every year, the politics of these structures often get neglected. Within the CTM 2015 festival theme “Un Tune,” the dissonances as well as consonances of these stories are being explored: both inclusion and exclusion play out in systems of sonic affect such as the dancefloor. Building on his extensive work on race, music, technology, and critical theory, CTM discourse programme co-curator Annie Goh interviewed Professor Alexander G. Weheliye on the racial politics of Berlin techno, and how its story being narrated.

This interview took place via Skype in December 2014, and is published in an abridged form in the CTM 2015 Magazine. The magazine will be available for purchase soon via Motto Distribution.



Annie Goh: Thanks for taking the time for this interview Alex. In the recent spate of books such as Felix Denk and Sven von Thülen's Klang der Familie, the story of the birth of Berlin Techno is told following the fall of the wall in 1989. This narrative tells of the jubilance of a reunified Germany, the masses of empty spaces, huge social change and upheaval, and the heady parties and clubs what emerged out of this. Denk and Von Thülen narrate this as an 'oral history', with interviews with various protagonists - DJs, promoters, club-owners, party goers, and the like. This is quite typical of the way this period is usually described - both as a story of German reunification and of the birth of Berlin Techno, an upheaval of previous hierarchies and radical openness within the arena of the dancefloor. How does this version of history compare to your own version?

Alexander Weheliye: First of all, I wouldn't say it is just my version of history. It is also the version of history that others like myself, non-white Germans have experienced. I see the narrativization of the reunification and the birth of Berlin Techno and the Berlin republic as part of a much longer tradition of thinking about Germany and German-ness. Throughout the post-WWII period, Germany had to reconstruct itself in many different ways and imagine itself as untainted by its Nazi past. One way it did that was by performing a kind of multi-cultural openness, however, only as long as that multiculturalism was located outside of Germany. That is one part of the larger discursive structure."
